Easily switch between multiple Go versions

## üìå About

Go already supports [installing multiple versions][1] simultaneously as separate binaries,
e.g. `go` (the main version) and `go1.19` (an additional version).
It works just fine when interacting with `go <command>` directly,
but could be inconvenient when the command is wrapped with something like `Makefile` or shell scripts.
The `goversion` tool attempts to solve this by symlinking `go1.X.Y` to `go`,
so any additional Go version could be used as if it was the main one.

```shell
> go version
go version go1.18 darwin/arm64

> goversion use 1.19
1.19 is not installed. Looking for it on go.dev ...
# Downloading ...
Switched to 1.19

> go version
go version go1.19 darwin/arm64
```

## üöÄ Features

* Use any additional Go version as the main one
* List installed Go versions (and, optionally, all available versions)
* Remove an installed Go version with a single command

## ‚úèÔ∏è Pre-requirements

`$GOBIN` (usually `$HOME/go/bin`) must be in your `$PATH` and it must take precedence over the location of the main Go binary (e.g. `/opt/homebrew/bin`).
